#Code the Matrix Week 1 Notes

##Course Intro Pt. 2
-  Python Sets, List, Dicts all fit with his approach to teaching Linear Algebra
-  Python comprehensions are his 'killer feature'
    +  produces set, list, dictionary
-  You need to practice these concepts. Write code
-  Memorize concepts
    +  Matrix * vector multiplication
    +  vector * matrix multiplication
    +  matrix * matrix multiplication
-  Mathematical proofs are needed
    +  don't skip them; they provide better insight into the theorems

###Assignments
-  Quizzes (given during the videos; no grade value; quiz answers may be required for later assignments; quiz answers graded via pattern matching)
-  Homework Assignments
    +  Biggest chunk of weekly work
    +  collection of problems
-  Labs
    +  like homework, but all focused towards on goal

##General Notes
-  I need to dig deeper into Iterators and Generators.
